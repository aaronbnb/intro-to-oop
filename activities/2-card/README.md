# Card

We've given you a skeleton for the Card constructor. 

You will add properties to the card. 

Point value for a card isn't so clear. You'll need a method isAce which determines whether the card is an ace.
You'll also need a method to calculate the value.

You should also create a property this.suits which returns an array of the suits.
You should also create a property this.ranks which returns an array of the ranks.
We'll need these later.
