## Create an instructor object

Work with your neighbor to create a new instructor

* Make an instructor constructor function

* An instructor should have properties for a name and a technology

* An instructor should be able to accept a teaching assignment. Is this method or a property? It's a method which will be the same for every instructor. Add a prototype for accept. It should take a course.

* Initialize a new instructor.
